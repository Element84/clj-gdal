## About [&#x219F;](#contents)

[GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/) (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) is a library
for reading and writing raster and vector geospatial data formats. GDAL
supports more than 120 data formats such as NOAA GTX, NASA ELAS, HF2/HFZ, ESRI
HDR, NetCDF, GeoTIFF, etc.

The clj-gdal project offers a Clojure wrapper around parts of the Java GDAL
library.


## Dependencies [&#x219F;](#contents)

Currently, only GDAL 2.0.1 support is provided.


## Getting Started [&#x219F;](#contents)

You must compile GDAL 2.0.1 Java SWIG bindings and add the generated libraries to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`

Then add clj-gdal a dependency to your lein project:
