## About [&#x219F;](#contents)

[GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/) (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) is a library
for reading and writing raster and vector geospatial data formats. GDAL
supports more than 120 data formats such as NOAA GTX, NASA ELAS, HF2/HFZ, ESRI
HDR, NetCDF, GeoTIFF, etc.

The clj-gdal project offers a Clojure wrapper around parts of the Java GDAL
library.


## Dependencies [&#x219F;](#contents)

* Java 1.7 or higher (uses java.nio via the nio Clojure wrapper)
* Java GDAL 2.0.0 library (included)

The Java library downloaded from Maven still requires that you have GDAL 2.x
compiled on your system, as it references libraries which GDAL builds.


## Usage [&#x219F;](#contents)

Add clj-gdal a dependency to your lein project:

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/clj-gdal/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/clj-gdal)

Then start up the Clojure REPL:

```bash
$ lein repl
```
```clojure
clj-gdal.core=> (init)
clj-gdal.core=> (open "LC80280302015112LGN00_B1.TIF")
```
